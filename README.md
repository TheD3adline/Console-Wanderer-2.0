# Console-Wanderer-2.0
First project of the Java online course from programmieren-starten.de, revised

Revised version of a small console game, a small interactive playfield with boundaries, player can walk freely within the field

I created this version as practice for better OOP, and with the goal to make the code more easily expandable later on from the get go
